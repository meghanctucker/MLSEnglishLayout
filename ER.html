                    <li>This is a paragraph of lorem ipsum text. I want to write some paragraphs in order to have some filler text on the page. Uusally a paragraph consistst of 3 to 5 sentences. The last sentence in the first paragraph is usually the thesis of the essay.</li>
                    <li>This is a second paragaph and it will have three sentences. Sometimes you write out a number and sometimes you just use the number. Really I'm just taking time to do this.</li>
                    <li>I don't know how this is going to look on the page or whether or not an ordered list is the correct way to go here. I guess it's going to take some experimentation.</li>
                    <li>The dolphins passage is really cool. I like it a lot because it talks about dolphins being friends and I'm pretty excited about that. </li>
